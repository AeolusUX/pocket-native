# Packages Pocket Native's app with the SDK's build tools, no Gradle: the
# manifest linked against the platform with the profiles as assets, the
# launcher's and the game's Java classes as classes.dex, the engine in
# lib/arm64-v8a, aligned and signed with the keystore, which is made the
# first time. Keep the keystore: an update signed with another one will not
# install over the app, which would have to be uninstalled first, saves and
# all. KEYSTORE_PASS is its password, "android" for a test key.
